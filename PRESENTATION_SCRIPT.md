## Q&A Preparation

### Likely Questions:

**Q: What data sources does this use?**
A: "In a production system, this would integrate with IoT sensors on equipment, safety incident databases, environmental monitoring stations, and weather data. For this demo, I'm using simulated data that represents realistic mining operations."

**Q: How accurate are the predictions?**
A: "Prediction accuracy depends on data quality and model training. Industry studies show predictive maintenance can achieve 85-95% accuracy. The 68% probability shown for the safety incident is based on historical patterns and current risk factors."

**Q: What technologies are used?**
A: "This is built with React and TypeScript for the frontend, Material-UI for the modern interface design, and Recharts for interactive visualizations including line charts, bar charts, pie charts, radar charts, scatter plots, and composed charts. The expandable chart feature uses Material-UI dialogs. In production, the backend would use machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow or scikit-learn for the predictive models."

**Q: How much does this reduce costs?**
A: "Industry research shows predictive maintenance can reduce maintenance costs by 25-30%, decrease downtime by 35-45%, and extend equipment life by 20%. Safety improvements reduce incident costs and insurance premiums. Environmental compliance prevents fines."

**Q: Can this integrate with existing systems?**
A: "Yes, modern mining operations use various systems (SCADA, ERP, etc.). This dashboard would integrate via APIs to pull data from existing sources and provide a unified view."

**Q: What about data security?**
A: "In production, this would implement role-based access control, encrypted data transmission, audit logging, and comply with industry security standards."

## Tips for Success

1. **Practice navigation** - Know exactly where to click
2. **Demonstrate expandable charts** - Click fullscreen icons to show the new feature
3. **Speak confidently** - You built this, you know it well
4. **Point with cursor** - Help audience follow along
5. **Emphasize predictive features** - That's the key differentiator
